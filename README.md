# HârnWorld Location Module: Chewintin Manor

Chewintin manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. It is designed to depict
the Chewintin manor in Asolade hundred, kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting; however, this manor
could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Located in the far south-western corner of the Kingdom of Kaldor, Chewintin Manor is
ruled by a bailiff for the Earl of Balim, the powerful Troda Dariune. Isolated and badly
ruled, the current bailiff is busy making Chewintin safe from Kath raids across the Kald
River.
